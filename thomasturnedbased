            Here we need to make things work out for the game
            it will require either switching or ifs (pillai may
            know which metric is better)
            the start will be short, just chaning the scene from
            top down to the other one then maybe do a luck calculation
            to find out who will go first or if that will alter things
            as well as get the data for the enemy and the character

            The player choice will open the players menu and show his
            stats as well as his actions from here it will go to
            the enemy turn which will call the ai to do thigns

            After this there will have to be calculations to check to see
            if the enemy or the hero's heath is at 0 thus changing to a 
            win or lose state.
